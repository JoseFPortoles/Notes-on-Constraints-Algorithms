        "The problem is to find the best path (lower accumulated traversing cost) in a graph from a starting node to a goal node.\n",
        "\n",
        "In branch and bound we keep a queue of paths that is initialised by a single path containing the root node. Keep extending the paths, removing paths with loops and sorting the queue according to accumulated cost of the path in such a way that the \"shortest\" path gets extended on the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Extended node filtering:**\n",
        "A more efficient way of searching for the best path is adding an extended node list to the branch and bound algorithm. If a path in the queue terminates at a node that has already been extended before (meaning that it has been reached by a better path before given the B&B queue dynamic), that path is not extended, just removed from the queue.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Admissible heuristic:**\n",
        "Another possible improvement respect to B&B is the use of a heuristic measure h that gives a lower bound of the remaining distance (cost) to the goal. The queue then is sorted on each iteration according to the sum of accumulated cost and estimated remaining cost (cost(Node) + h(Node)). Once the goal node is found (path B), any other path whose cost+h is higher than cost(B) is known to be worse than B (given that h is a lower bound to remaining cost, so the actual cost of the path to goal is going to be even higher) and therefore not worth extending.\n",

        "**${A^*}$ algorithm:**\n",
        "Since the two modifications explained above seem to have advantages, there is the possibility to combine them and see if it yields further improvements. $A^*$ is then a Branch and Bound algorithm with extended node filtering and admissible heuristic of the remaining cost to goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consistency:**\n",
        "Branch and bound and extended node filtering provide optimal search improvements over blind search counterparts such as Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). However, the use of an admissible heuristic and the $A^*$ algorithm, while advantageous in maps, where the positions of the graph nodes reflect euclidian distances, can end up in missing the best path in graphs that are not maps. In these cases it still is possible to use a heuristic that is consistent rather than simply admissible. Consistency is:\n",

If we expand that initial path to the children nodes, as in the first iteration of the WHILE loop, then at least one of the expanded paths will be a subpath of B.

In a case like that it makes no sense to backtrack to the previous (i-1) level and start testing again the values of the $z_i$'s domain. Since the values or all the previous variable $z_1,\\ldots,z_{i-2}$ are the same, the tesst for the constraints $C\\left(z_1,z_{i}\\right)$ to $C\\left(z_{i-2},z_{i}\\right)$ will fail again for all the $z_i$ values.
